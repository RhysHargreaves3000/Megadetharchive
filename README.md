# Megadetharchive
Work in progress project, work halted while I learn React/JavaScript


This website is a fan work for the band Megadeth, the goal for the website is to be an easy and intuitive Library for anyone interested in the band to go and learn more about them
In the end the website will have 

- An album page containing links to all studio recorded Albums (complete)
- An Artist page containing all of the people that have done significant work on Megadeths Studio work, this will also have child pages for the current members and non members will
have links to their socials(if any) displayed within an expandable box (WIP)
- Gallery for high res album cover art and the makers of the album art (No Progress)
- Equipment page for the current members favourite equipment/setups (No progress)
- Contact page (mainly for megadeth but my contact details wil probably be in this page too)(No Progress)

I expect that once i am proficient with JavaScript the website will continue production but for now its Shelved
